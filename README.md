# Overview

Eddy Current Testing (ECT) is a way to test surface defect without destroying the original structure of the material. For this github project, it is designed to show the code for the data processing and graphics presentation. Traditionally, only impedance against time graph could be drawn. In this project, impedance against distance is successfully achieved. Changing x-axis from time to distance can help locate the defect more easily. The code of how this is realised is shown here.

# User Installation Instructions

## 1. Install Python Interprenter

To install the Python interpreter, follow the instructions below:

1. Visit the official Python website at 'https://www.python.org/'.
2. Hover over the 'Downloads' tab and click on the version of Python that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, MacOS, or Linux/UNIX).
3. Once the download is complete, open the installer.
4. During the installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking 'Install Now'.
5. After the installation is complete, you can confirm that Python was successfully installed by opening a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS, Linux) and typing 'python --version'. This should display the version of Python that you installed.

Note: Python 3.x is recommended for this project as Python 2.x is no longer maintained.

## 2. Install Python libraries

In order to run programs smoothly, several python libraries are needed to install first. The following are some examples of how you may install these libraries on Windows.

### Install math library

```jsx

```

## 3. Download the Github Python project

To download the project files, follow the instructions below:

1. Visit the Github repository page for the project.
2. Click on the 'Code' button and then click 'Download ZIP'.
3. Once the download is complete, locate the ZIP file on your computer and unzip it. This will create a new folder that contains all the files from the Github repository.

Ensure that you have saved and unzipped the files in a location you can easily access, as you will need to navigate to this folder in the command prompt or terminal to run the Python program.
